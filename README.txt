Assignment 3: Linked Lists

Software: Dev-C++
Compiler: GCC

Doubly Linked List: 

A DLL is like a Singly Linked List, but it contains an extra pointer called previous pointer.
A DLL can be advantageous over a SLL because it can be traversed in both forward and backward
direction. Deleting nodes in DLL is more efficient because previous node is accessible and
traversing through the list to get the previous node isnt needed.

Circular Linked List:

A CLL is a Linked List where all nodes are linked in a continuous circle without using null.
CLL data structure is very useful in such keeping track of whose turn it is in a multi-player 
board game. Putting all the players in a CLL and advancing to the next player in the list.
